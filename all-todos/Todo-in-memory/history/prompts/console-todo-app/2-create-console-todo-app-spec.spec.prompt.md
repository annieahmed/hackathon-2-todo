# Create Console Todo App Spec

## User Input

In-Memory Python Console Todo Application Target audience: Beginner to intermediate Python learners and reviewers evaluating agentic development workflows using Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus. Objective: Design and implement an in-memory, console-based Todo application using Python. The application must follow the Agentic Dev Stack workflow (spec → plan → tasks → implementation) with no manual coding. All development must be performed via Claude Code. Focus: - Clean, readable Python code - Proper project structure - In-memory task management (no files, no databases) - Demonstration of agent-driven software development Core Features (Basic Level – all required): 1. Add a new todo task 2. View all tasks 3. Update an existing task 4. Mark a task as completed 5. Delete a task Success Criteria: - All 5 core features are fully implemented and working - Tasks are stored only in memory during runtime - Console interface is clear and user-friendly - Code follows clean code principles (readable names, modular functions) - Project follows proper Python structure (main file, logical separation) - Agentic Dev Stack workflow is clearly demonstrated - No manual code edits; all code generated by Claude Code Constraints: - Language: Python 3.13+ - Runtime: Console / Command Line - Storage: In-memory only (lists, dictionaries, or objects) - Tools: Claude Code + Spec-Kit Plus - Package Manager: UV - Timeline: Single development phase (Phase I) Technology Stack: - Python 3.13+ - UV package manager - Claude Code - Spec-Kit Plus Not Building: - File-based persistence (JSON, TXT, DB) - GUI or web interface - User authentication - Advanced features (priorities, deadlines, reminders) - External libraries beyond standard Python Deliverables: - Functional console-based todo application - Clear agent-generated specification, plan, task breakdown, and implementation - Demonstration-ready project suitable for evaluation

## Response Summary

Successfully created a comprehensive feature specification for the Console Todo Application with:

- 5 detailed user stories covering all core features (add, view, update, complete, delete tasks)
- Clear acceptance scenarios for each user story
- 9 functional requirements defining system capabilities
- Key entities identified (Todo Task and Task List)
- 6 measurable success criteria
- Edge cases addressed
- Quality checklist completed

The specification follows the agentic development workflow and avoids implementation details, focusing on user value and business needs.

## Outcome

The specification file was successfully created at specs/001-console-todo-app/spec.md with all required sections completed. The quality checklist was created at specs/001-console-todo-app/checklists/requirements.md and all items were validated as complete. The feature branch 001-console-todo-app is ready for the next phase of development.
