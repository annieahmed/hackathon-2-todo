# Feature Specification: Console Todo Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-console-todo-app`
**Created**: 2026-01-14
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "In-Memory Python Console Todo Application Target audience: Beginner to intermediate Python learners and reviewers evaluating agentic development workflows using Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus. Objective: Design and implement an in-memory, console-based Todo application using Python. The application must follow the Agentic Dev Stack workflow (spec → plan → tasks → implementation) with no manual coding. All development must be performed via Claude Code. Focus: - Clean, readable Python code - Proper project structure - In-memory task management (no files, no databases) - Demonstration of agent-driven software development Core Features (Basic Level – all required): 1. Add a new todo task 2. View all tasks 3. Update an existing task 4. Mark a task as completed 5. Delete a task Success Criteria: - All 5 core features are fully implemented and working - Tasks are stored only in memory during runtime - Console interface is clear and user-friendly - Code follows clean code principles (readable names, modular functions) - Project follows proper Python structure (main file, logical separation) - Agentic Dev Stack workflow is clearly demonstrated - No manual code edits; all code generated by Claude Code Constraints: - Language: Python 3.13+ - Runtime: Console / Command Line - Storage: In-memory only (lists, dictionaries, or objects) - Tools: Claude Code + Spec-Kit Plus - Package Manager: UV - Timeline: Single development phase (Phase I) Technology Stack: - Python 3.13+ - UV package manager - Claude Code - Spec-Kit Plus Not Building: - File-based persistence (JSON, TXT, DB) - GUI or web interface - User authentication - Advanced features (priorities, deadlines, reminders) - External libraries beyond standard Python Deliverables: - Functional console-based todo application - Clear agent-generated specification, plan, task breakdown, and implementation - Demonstration-ready project suitable for evaluation"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Add a new todo task (Priority: P1)

A user wants to add a new task to their todo list. They open the console application, select the option to add a new task, enter the task description, and confirm. The task is added to their in-memory list and displayed in the task view.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational feature that enables users to actually use the todo application. Without the ability to add tasks, the other features have no data to work with.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adding a task and verifying it appears in the task list, delivering the core value of capturing tasks.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user is at the main menu, **When** user selects "Add Task" option and enters a task description, **Then** the task is added to the in-memory list and confirmed to the user
2. **Given** user has entered an empty task description, **When** user attempts to add the task, **Then** the system prompts for a valid task description

---

### User Story 2 - View all tasks (Priority: P1)

A user wants to see all their current tasks. They open the console application and select the option to view all tasks. The system displays a numbered list of all tasks with their completion status.

**Why this priority**: This is a core feature that allows users to see what they have planned. It's essential for the utility of a todo application.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by viewing the task list after adding tasks, delivering the core value of seeing all tasks in one place.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has added multiple tasks, **When** user selects "View All Tasks" option, **Then** all tasks are displayed with their IDs and completion status
2. **Given** user has no tasks in the list, **When** user selects "View All Tasks" option, **Then** the system displays a message indicating no tasks exist

---

### User Story 3 - Mark a task as completed (Priority: P2)

A user wants to mark a specific task as completed. They view their tasks, identify the task they've completed, select the option to mark it as completed, and confirm the action. The task's status is updated to show as completed.

**Why this priority**: This allows users to track their progress and distinguish between completed and pending tasks, which is a core function of a todo application.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by marking a task as completed and verifying its status updates, delivering the value of tracking task completion.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has a list of pending tasks, **When** user selects "Mark Task Completed" and specifies a valid task ID, **Then** the task status is updated to completed and confirmed to the user
2. **Given** user specifies an invalid task ID, **When** user attempts to mark the task as completed, **Then** the system prompts for a valid task ID

---

### User Story 4 - Update an existing task (Priority: P2)

A user wants to modify the description of an existing task. They view their tasks, identify the task they want to update, select the update option, specify the task ID, enter the new description, and confirm. The task description is updated in the list.

**Why this priority**: This allows users to refine their tasks as needed, which is important for maintaining an accurate todo list.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by updating a task description and verifying the change, delivering the value of maintaining accurate task information.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has a list of tasks, **When** user selects "Update Task" and specifies a valid task ID with a new description, **Then** the task description is updated and confirmed to the user
2. **Given** user specifies an invalid task ID, **When** user attempts to update the task, **Then** the system prompts for a valid task ID

---

### User Story 5 - Delete a task (Priority: P3)

A user wants to remove a task from their list, either because it's no longer needed or has been completed outside the application. They view their tasks, identify the task to delete, select the delete option, specify the task ID, and confirm. The task is removed from the list.

**Why this priority**: This allows users to clean up their task list by removing tasks that are no longer relevant, which helps maintain focus on important tasks.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by deleting a task and verifying it no longer appears in the list, delivering the value of maintaining a clean task list.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has a list of tasks, **When** user selects "Delete Task" and specifies a valid task ID, **Then** the task is removed from the list and confirmed to the user
2. **Given** user specifies an invalid task ID, **When** user attempts to delete the task, **Then** the system prompts for a valid task ID

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the user enters invalid input for menu selections?
- How does the system handle extremely long task descriptions?
- What happens when the user tries to operate on a task ID that doesn't exist?
- How does the system handle empty inputs when a value is required?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to add new todo tasks with a description
- **FR-002**: System MUST display all tasks with their unique identifiers and completion status
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to mark existing tasks as completed
- **FR-004**: Users MUST be able to update the description of existing tasks
- **FR-005**: Users MUST be able to delete tasks from the list
- **FR-006**: System MUST store all tasks in memory only, with no persistence after application exit
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide a clear, menu-driven console interface for all operations
- **FR-008**: System MUST validate user inputs and handle invalid entries gracefully
- **FR-009**: System MUST assign unique identifiers to each task automatically

### Key Entities

- **Todo Task**: Represents a single task with properties: unique identifier, description text, completion status (pending/completed)
- **Task List**: Collection of Todo Tasks stored in memory during application runtime
